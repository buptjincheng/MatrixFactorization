MatrixFactorization
===================

Java implementation of Matrix factorization model for recommendation

Matrix Factorization uses latent model for recommendation. Basically, it is the process of completing the empty 
entries in the matrix, where the matrix is usualy very sparse. Each enty in the matrix represents the interaction between 
user and item pair, usually denotes the rating given by user. 

The code implements the matrix factorization techniques proposed in the paper:
